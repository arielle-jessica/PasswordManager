# PasswordManager
CLI password manager which uses duo for an elevated authentication along with the master password , database is used to store the passwords
The browser extension version uses the same underlying principle as the cli but as a browser extension using api and front end technologies like node js. Chrome is used for the browser extesnion part xoxo :)
